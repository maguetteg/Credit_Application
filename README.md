In order to minimize losses and maximize profits, banks must carefully review financing requests. 
The purpose of this project is to develop a model to assist a fictional financial institution in improving its financing approval process. 
To do so, we have access to a large database containing information about loans granted to a group of individuals, as well as the profit or loss incurred on these loans two years later. 
Our goal is to maximize the bank's profits.      


To accomplish this task, several algorithms will be considered (logistic regression, random forest, K-means, boosting techniques, etc.) and their performances will be compared.
